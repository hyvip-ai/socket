This project was created due to my requirement, one day I need to take note during a zoom call and I need to separately open a tab for that, so I though may be create a website where we can do both, and as I was learning socket.io , I created the website.

In this website we have to login first with username and room id and then we can share the room id with others so that they can join , now after that they can engage in video call or chat, and during video call if they need to write something down they have collaborative docs so that everyone can watch it also they have a whiteboard which is also realtime and collaborative for brainstorming.

The projet is not perfect but its only the foundation of a big project.
